Roll for Food is a program designed to combat decision paralysis by letting the dice (or the random module, in this case) decide where to order from.

Version 1 is based off of a prewritten .csv file listing local and heavily frequented restaurants for the recipient of this program. When the button is pressed, the program cycles through the list of food categories pulled from the DataFrame to provide a suggestion. (Uploaded 12/16/23)
